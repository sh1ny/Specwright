# Specwright Roadmap

Three project files sit above OpenSpec changes. Paths come from `project:` in `openspec/specwright.yaml`; defaults are below. Templates are in this skill's `references/`.

| File | Default | Holds | Changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategy | `openspec/strategy.md` | Purpose, users, boundaries, metrics | Rarely |
| Architecture | `openspec/architecture.md` | System shape + index of in-force ADRs (`docs/adr/`) | When an ADR is added or superseded |
| Roadmap | `openspec/roadmap.md` | Milestones: outcome, exit criteria, changes | At every milestone close |

Status is derived, never stored. A milestone is done when all its changes are done and every exit criterion has passed. A change's status depends on where its planning lives (**Planning repo** below):

- **Main branches.** In pr mode PRs merge on GitHub, so local `<main>` lags: run `git fetch origin <main>` in each repo (store-backed: the code repo and the store) and read `origin/<main>`. Where there is no `origin` or the fetch fails, read that repo's local `<main>` and say its status may be stale (`store status may be stale: fetch failed`). Local mode reads local `<main>`.
- **Archive.** `git -C <planning toplevel> ls-tree -d --name-only <planning main> <P>/changes/archive/`, matched by the archive name (**Archive name** below: a change named `YYYY-MM-DD-...` is matched as is, never prefixed twice).
- **Repo-local:** a change is **done** when the main branch holds its archive (in pr mode that means its PR merged, not just that archive ran on the branch); otherwise it is not done.
- **Store-backed:** the archive on the store's main shows only that the planning merged. The change is **done** only when the store's main holds its archive and one of these proves the code side merged as a whole:
  - the archive directory on the store's main holds `specwright-change.yaml` with `code_changes: none` (a planning-only change; `git -C <store toplevel> show <store main>:<P>/changes/archive/<archived-name>/specwright-change.yaml`);
  - `local` mode: `git -C <code toplevel> log --first-parent --format=%s <code main>` has the exact subject `merge: <change-name>`;
  - `pr` mode: a merged code PR from the code repo's own `<prefix>/<change-name>` branch into the code main, `<prefix>` derived from the change name exactly as `specwright-branch` does (step 6). Find it with complete discovery, run from the code checkout (through `bash <specwright-pr>/scripts/as.sh <github.login>` when `github.login` is set, `<specwright-pr>` being that skill's folder): `gh api --paginate "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls?state=closed&base=<code main>&per_page=100" --jq '.[] | select(.merged_at != null and .head.repo.full_name == "<owner>/<repo>" and .head.ref == "<prefix>/<change-name>") | .number'`, with `<owner>/<repo>` from the code repo's `origin` and `GH_REPO` unset. A PR merged into another base, from a fork's same-named branch, or from another prefix's branch (`docs/<change-name>` for a `feat` change) is not proof.

  A subject that merely contains `(<change-name>)` is not proof: a cherry-picked task commit has it while the rest of the change is unmerged. Without proof the change is **planning merged, code pending**. In pr mode, when `gh` is not available it is **planning merged, code unverified**, and when the discovery call fails (non-zero exit) it is **planning merged, code state unknown**. None of these counts as done, for status, **next** or **close**.

**Committing project files** (init and close): start from a clean main (in pr mode, `git pull --ff-only origin <main>` first) and `git checkout -b <branch>` before writing anything, commit the files you wrote by name with a `docs(<branch-name>): ...` subject, then finish per `finish` in `openspec/specwright.yaml`: `local` → merge into main with `--no-ff` and subject `merge: <branch-name>`, delete the branch, never push; `pr` → `specwright-pr` **ship**. There is no change to archive, so `specwright-finish` does not apply.

Store-backed (see the Planning repo section of `specwright-commit`): the store's gate lock, the same `specwright-gate.lock` that `specwright-branch` takes for a change, guards the branch, so a roadmap branch and a change branch never pass their gates together. Run this gate before any branch or write in either repo; which repo holds each project file does not change. Every command that uses the lock starts with `cd "<store toplevel>" && L="$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/specwright-gate.lock" &&` (shell variables do not survive between calls).
1. **Lock**, in one call: `... && mkdir "$L" && printf 'time: %s\nchange: %s\ncode: %s\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "<branch>" "<code toplevel>" > "$L/owner"`. If the lock is held (`mkdir` errors because it exists): stop before any branch or write in either repo, show `owner` (when, for which change or branch, from which checkout) and say another session may be in its gate for this store. Never remove a lock another session took: only the user can confirm it is stale.
2. **Check** the store: it must be clean and on its main (`planning_store.main_branch`, else `main`, else `master`). On a branch other than its main, the store is busy with that branch: stop. Dirty: stop and show `git -C "<store toplevel>" status --short`. `<branch>` already exists in the store: stop. Each of these stops releases the lock first (step 4).
3. **Branch**: `git checkout -b <branch>` in the store, and from the clean code main in the code repo when files are written there too.
4. **Release** only the lock you took, right after the branch exists, in one call that sets `L` again: `... && rm -r "$L"`.

Then, before each step that writes project files in the store, run `test "$(git -C "<store toplevel>" branch --show-current)" = <branch>`, and commit store files in one call: `cd "<store toplevel>" && test "$(git branch --show-current)" = <branch> && git add -- <files> && git commit -F <msgfile> -- <files>`. When the check fails (the store is on another branch), stop with no further write or commit in either repo, and name both branches: `<branch>` expected, and the store's current branch found.

## init

Input: the user's project idea (any size), plus the repo if code exists. Work on branch `docs/project-baseline` (see Committing project files).

1. **Adopt before writing.** If strategy, architecture or planning documents already exist, point the `project:` settings at them or extract from them; do not rewrite what is there.
2. **Interview, briefly.** List the gaps that would change the architecture or the first milestone: users, platform, scope and non-goals, hard constraints, data and its sensitivity, success measures. Ask them in at most two batched rounds, each question with a recommended default. Everything else becomes a stated assumption.
3. **Strategy** (`references/strategy.md`), one page.
4. **Architecture baseline** (`references/architecture.md`). Run the design triage (T1-T6 from the schema's design instruction) for the whole system, not one change. Write the component diagram, state ownership, boundaries and contracts, resource bounds and failure visibility at system level - brief, a few lines per row. Record the foundational decisions as ADRs (process and isolate model, storage and formats, IPC and contracts, state management, external integrations), each with a rejected alternative and its reversal cost, written with `Status: proposed`. A proposed ADR is still a draft: when the review asks to change a decision, edit the ADR in place, never by a superseding ADR. Ground in the code if it exists; otherwise check claims about the stack against its docs.
5. **Review** the strategy, architecture and ADRs the same way a FULL design is reviewed (cross-model CLI unless `review.cross_model` is `false`, else the `specwright-reviewer` agent in baseline mode, given those file paths and the installed project skills that apply, each by name with the path of its installed `SKILL.md`, or `none`; never a `specwright-*` workflow skill), into `openspec/architecture-review.md`. Rounds follow the schema's review rule: each full review is a new round; after 2 consecutive `VERDICT: REVISE` rounds, stop and ask the user, and write no roadmap until they decide (`VERDICT: USER_OVERRIDE` if they choose to proceed). There is no other round cap, and a pass ends a run of REVISE rounds. A pass covers only the content reviewed: any later edit to the strategy, architecture or ADRs voids it and gets a new round without asking the user, except the acceptance edit below. This is the one place a review always runs: early architecture mistakes are the most expensive ones. Gate: do not write the roadmap until the review passes the same precheck as tasks (APPROVE; APPROVE_WITH_CHANGES with `CHANGES_APPLIED: yes` set by the reviewer; or USER_OVERRIDE after escalation). When it passes, accept the ADRs: set each reviewed ADR's `Status: proposed` to `Status: accepted` with today's date and add its row to the architecture's in-force index, which lists accepted ADRs only. This acceptance edit is part of passing the gate and does not void the verdict. Only then write the roadmap. An accepted ADR not yet on main (a PR fix round on this branch) may still be edited, but the edit voids the review like any other; once on main it is never edited.
6. **Roadmap** (`references/roadmap.md`):
   - M1 is a walking skeleton: the thinnest end-to-end slice through the architecture, which proves the riskiest assumptions first.
   - Each milestone has a demoable outcome and exit criteria that can be checked, each marked agent- or user-verified.
   - Only the current milestone is split into changes (2-6, each about one PR). Next gets a paragraph, Later one line each.
7. Commit and finish (see Committing project files). Then offer **next**.

## next

1. Read the roadmap's Now section. Run `openspec list --json` for active changes, and derive done changes from the main branch as above.
2. Active change in progress → offer to resume it instead.
3. Otherwise pick the first planned change that has no archive and whose prerequisites are all **done** (a prerequisite that is planning merged, code pending, unverified or unknown is not done). An archived change whose code is pending is never started again: report it and what it is waiting for (its code PR or merge). If none is left but exit criteria still fail, propose a new change that closes the gap, without editing any file yet: the roadmap entry is written in step 4, on the change's branch.
4. Start `/opsx:propose <change-name>` (`specwright-branch` runs first). For a gap-closing change from step 3, as soon as `specwright-branch` has created `<prefix>/<change-name>` and before any planning artifact is written: add the change to the current milestone's Changes, then commit only the roadmap file by name in the repo that holds it, in one call with the branch check: `cd "<that repo's toplevel>" && test "$(git branch --show-current)" = <prefix>/<change-name> && git add -- <roadmap file> && git commit -F <msgfile> -- <roadmap file>`, subject `docs(<change-name>): add <change-name> to the roadmap` (store-backed: also run the store branch check from Committing project files first). Then propose continues. If the gate stops, nothing was edited: leave the roadmap untouched. The entry merges with the change. Give the proposal its context: the milestone, the exit criteria this change serves, and the ADRs that constrain it. The proposal names its milestone.

## close

1. Every change of the milestone done (on main, as derived above)? If not, list what is left and stop.
2. Walk the exit criteria. Run agent-verifiable checks yourself. Ask the user to run user-verified ones and record their results; anything skipped is recorded as unverified, never passed.
3. Any criterion fails → propose the change that fixes it (via **next**); do not close. Any criterion unverified → list it and stop; the milestone stays in Now until it has a passing result.
4. Close on branch `docs/close-<milestone>` (see Committing project files): move the milestone to Done with the date and one line on what was learned.
5. Re-plan with what the milestone taught: promote Next to Now and split it into changes; revise Later. If an architecture assumption broke, write a new ADR with `Status: proposed` and `Supersedes: <number>`, review it as init step 5 reviews the baseline (a new round in `openspec/architecture-review.md`, same escalation rule), and accept it only after that gate passes (`Status: accepted` with the date, its index row in, the superseded ADR's row out). Never edit an accepted ADR: the superseded ADR's file stays unchanged.
6. Commit and finish like init.

## status

One answer, no edits: current milestone, its changes (done / planning merged, code pending / code unverified / code state unknown / active / planned, derived as above, one status per change with its proof), the stale note when a fetch failed, exit criteria state, and what **next** would start.

## Rules

- Keep it small: the strategy is one page, the roadmap one or two, the architecture a few pages plus ADRs. Detail lives in OpenSpec changes, not here.
- The roadmap is a plan, not a contract. Change it whenever a milestone teaches something; record why in the Done line.
- Never mark a user-verified criterion passed on the user's behalf.

## Planning repo

OpenSpec decides where planning lives: in this repo, in a folder nested in it, or in a store (a separate git repo). Resolve it at the start of every run, before any write; never assume `./openspec/`.

1. **Root:** `openspec list --json` from the code checkout, plus `--store <id>` when the session selected a store. It needs no change name, writes nothing and still works after archive. `root` null with an error whose `message` starts with `Declared in` or `Invalid store declaration in` → stop before any git or file write and show that `message` and `fix`.
2. **Repo**, in one call: `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir --show-toplevel && git -C "<root.path>" rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir --show-toplevel`.
   - The second fails (root not in a git work tree) → stop and ask: initialise git there, or abort.
   - Different common dir → **store-backed**: the planning repo is the store checkout at its toplevel.
   - Same common dir and toplevel → **repo-local** (including a root nested in this checkout, such as `planning/`): one repo, as before.
   - Same common dir, different toplevel → the root is in another worktree of this repo, where a commit would land on that worktree's branch. Stop before any write, name both worktrees (path and branch) and ask.
3. Announce once: `Code repo: <toplevel>; planning repo: <toplevel> (store <root.store_id>)` or `(same repo)`.

**Paths.** `<P>` is `<root.path>/openspec` made relative to the planning repo's toplevel (`openspec` in the usual layout, `planning/openspec` for a nested root). Stage and `ls-tree` planning files as `<P>/...` in the planning repo.

**Where commands run.** Git, `gh` and `as.sh` commands on the store run in one shell call that starts with `cd "<store toplevel>" &&` (`as.sh` only fences the repo it starts in). `openspec templates` and `openspec schema validate` have no root selection: run them with `cd "<root.path>" &&`. `git -C` is for read-only queries only (`rev-parse`, `status`, `log`, `ls-tree`).

**Archive name.** Use `archivedAs` from the archive output when you have it. Otherwise it is the change name if that starts with `YYYY-MM-DD-`, else `YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>`: `<P>/changes/archive/<archived-name>/`.

**Referenced stores.** A `references:` list in the root's `config.yaml` does not move the planning root: a repo with its own root stays repo-local. Referenced stores are read-only: never branch, commit, stash, push, open a PR or write a file in one. Read them only through `openspec context --json` (each `members` entry with `role: referenced_store` gives its `path` and a `fetch` command such as `openspec show <spec-id> --type spec --store <id>`). A member whose `status` has `reference_unresolved` (the store is not registered on this machine) is named in the report as `unresolved reference: <id>` with its `fix`, and the step continues without it; never guess its path.
