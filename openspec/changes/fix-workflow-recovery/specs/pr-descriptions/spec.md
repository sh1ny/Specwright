# Spec Delta

## Purpose

Makes the issues a PR says it fixes the issues GitHub closes when it merges: closing references are written one per issue, checked against GitHub's closing list after ship, and any intended issue still open after the merge is closed at cleanup.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: One closing keyword per issue
A PR description written by Specwright SHALL give each issue the PR fully resolves its own closing keyword on its own line (`Fixes #N`). An issue the PR does not fully resolve SHALL be named with `Related: #N`. In a store-backed change, closing lines SHALL go on the PR in the repository that holds the issues; when no PR is expected there, the existing PR SHALL carry them as `Fixes <owner>/<repo>#N`.

#### Scenario: PR fixing three issues
- **WHEN** ship writes the description of a PR that fully resolves issues 21, 24 and 43
- **THEN** the description has the three lines `Fixes #21`, `Fixes #24` and `Fixes #43`, and no line names two issues after one keyword

#### Scenario: Partly resolved issue
- **WHEN** the PR resolves issue 21 fully and issue 52 only in part
- **THEN** the description has `Fixes #21` and `Related: #52`, and no closing keyword names 52

#### Scenario: Planning-only store-backed change
- **WHEN** a planning-only store-backed change fully resolves issue 21 of the code repository, so only the store PR exists
- **THEN** the store PR's description has `Fixes <code owner>/<code repo>#21` on its own line

### Requirement: Closing references are checked after ship
After ship creates or finds a PR, Specwright SHALL compare the issues its description's closing lines name with the issues GitHub reports it will close. On a PR ship just created, a mismatch SHALL be fixed by rewriting the description with one keyword per issue and checked once more. On an existing PR, a mismatch SHALL be reported and the description left unchanged unless the user asks.

#### Scenario: Description matches
- **WHEN** ship creates a PR whose description has `Fixes #21` and `Fixes #24`, and GitHub reports issues 21 and 24 as closing
- **THEN** the check reports a match, and the description is not edited

#### Scenario: Several issues after one keyword on a new PR
- **WHEN** ship creates a PR whose description has `Fixes #24, #21, #43`, and GitHub reports only issue 24 as closing
- **THEN** the check names 21 and 43 as missing, the description is rewritten with one `Fixes` line per issue, and a second check reports a match

#### Scenario: Mismatch on an existing PR
- **WHEN** ship finds an existing PR whose description names issue 43 on a closing line and GitHub does not report 43 as closing
- **THEN** ship reports 43 as missing, leaves the description unchanged, and asks the user whether to rewrite it

#### Scenario: Still missing after the rewrite
- **WHEN** after the rewrite GitHub still does not report an issue named on a closing line, for example because the issue number does not exist
- **THEN** ship stops, names that issue, and does not report the PR as ready

#### Scenario: Issue linked by hand only
- **WHEN** an existing PR's closing lines name issue 21, and GitHub reports issues 21 and 30 as closing because 30 was linked in the sidebar
- **THEN** the check reports a match with 30 listed as extra, and ship asks nothing

#### Scenario: Closing list cannot be read
- **WHEN** the GitHub lookup for the PR's closing issues fails
- **THEN** the check exits with GitHub state unknown, and ship reports the check as not done rather than as a match

#### Scenario: Closing keyword inside code
- **WHEN** a description shows ``` ``Fixes #21`` ``` as an inline code example, or inside a fenced block
- **THEN** the check does not count issue 21 as intended

#### Scenario: Numbered closing line
- **WHEN** a description has the line `1. Fixes #24, #21, #43`, and GitHub reports only issue 24 as closing
- **THEN** the check names 21 and 43 as missing

#### Scenario: Unmatched backtick
- **WHEN** a description has the line ``Fixes #21 (see `notes)`` whose single backtick is never closed
- **THEN** the backtick is literal text, and the check counts issue 21 as intended

### Requirement: Closing references need the default branch
When a PR's base is not its repository's default branch, the check SHALL report that GitHub will not close the issues its closing lines name. Ship SHALL NOT rewrite the description and SHALL NOT stop for that reason.

#### Scenario: PR into a branch other than the default
- **WHEN** ship creates a PR into a branch other than the repository's default branch, and its description has `Fixes #21`
- **THEN** the check reports that the base is not the default branch, the description is not edited, and ship reports that #21 will not be closed by this PR

#### Scenario: Default branch cannot be read
- **WHEN** the lookup of the repository's default branch fails
- **THEN** the check exits with GitHub state unknown, and ship reports the check as not done

### Requirement: Issues a merged PR left open are closed at cleanup
When Specwright cleans up after a PR merged into its repository's default branch, it SHALL read the issues the PR's closing lines name in the change's repositories and close each one that is still open and was never closed before, with a comment naming the PR, using the identity of the issue's repository. Issues outside the change's repositories, and issues a person reopened, SHALL be reported and not closed. Issues named only by `Related:` SHALL NOT be closed.

#### Scenario: Merged PR left an issue open
- **WHEN** a merged PR's closing lines name issues 21 and 24, issue 21 is closed and issue 24 is still open
- **THEN** cleanup closes 24 with a comment naming the PR, and does not touch 21

#### Scenario: Every intended issue closed
- **WHEN** every issue a merged PR's closing lines name is closed
- **THEN** cleanup closes nothing and posts no comment

#### Scenario: Related issue still open
- **WHEN** a merged PR's description has `Related: #52`, and issue 52 is open
- **THEN** cleanup does not close 52

#### Scenario: Related reference on a closing line
- **WHEN** a merged PR's description has the line `Fixes #21; Related: #52`, issue 21 is closed and issue 52 is open
- **THEN** 52 is not an intended issue, and cleanup does not close it

#### Scenario: Closing line without a closing list
- **WHEN** a merged PR's description has the line `Fixes the crash; Related: #52`, and issue 52 is open
- **THEN** 52 is not an intended issue, and cleanup does not close it

#### Scenario: Closing keyword hidden from the rendered description
- **WHEN** a merged PR's description shows `Fixes #52` only in an indented code block (also one directly after a heading), a code span that continues onto the next line, or an HTML comment, and issue 52 is open
- **THEN** 52 is not an intended issue, and cleanup does not close it

#### Scenario: Issue in another repository
- **WHEN** a merged PR's closing line names `other/tool#5`, which is not one of the change's repositories
- **THEN** cleanup does not read or close that issue, and reports it as outside the change

#### Scenario: PR not merged
- **WHEN** cleanup runs for a PR that was closed without merging
- **THEN** no issue is closed

#### Scenario: PR into a branch other than the default, at cleanup
- **WHEN** cleanup runs for a merged PR whose base is not its repository's default branch, and its closing lines name open issue 21
- **THEN** cleanup does not close 21 and reports that it stays open until the fix reaches the default branch

#### Scenario: Issue reopened after it was closed
- **WHEN** issue 24, named on a merged PR's closing line, was closed and then reopened by a person
- **THEN** cleanup does not close 24 again and reports it as reopened

#### Scenario: Closing an issue fails
- **WHEN** cleanup closes issue 21 and then fails to close issue 24
- **THEN** cleanup reports 21 as closed and 24 as still open, continues its branch cleanup, and a later cleanup closes only 24

#### Scenario: Issue state cannot be read
- **WHEN** the lookup of the PR, or of an intended issue in the change's repositories, fails
- **THEN** the check exits with GitHub state unknown, cleanup reports the backstop as not done, closes nothing, and continues its branch cleanup
