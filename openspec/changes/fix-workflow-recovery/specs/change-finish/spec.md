# Spec Delta

## Purpose

Lets `specwright-finish` complete a change that an earlier finish run left partly done, by reading which finish steps git already shows as done instead of repeating or skipping them.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Finish resumes from git evidence
When finish runs for a change whose archive is already committed, it SHALL derive what is done from git in each repo of the change: an archive commit on the change branch, a `merge: <change-name>` commit on main's first-parent history, and whether the change branch still exists. It SHALL continue from the first step not done and SHALL NOT repeat a done step.

#### Scenario: Interrupted after the archive commit, local mode
- **WHEN** a repo-local change in `finish: local` has its archive commit on the change branch, the branch is not merged, and finish runs again
- **THEN** no second archive commit is made, main gets one `merge: <change-name>` commit, and the change branch is deleted

#### Scenario: Interrupted after the merge, before the branch deletion
- **WHEN** main already has `merge: <change-name>` and the change branch still exists, fully merged
- **THEN** finish makes no new merge commit and deletes the branch with `git branch -d`

#### Scenario: Interrupted after the archive commit, pr mode
- **WHEN** a change in `finish: pr` has its archive commit on the change branch, not yet pushed, and finish runs again
- **THEN** no second archive commit is made, and ship pushes the branch and reports the PR

#### Scenario: Every repo already done
- **WHEN** every repo of the change has `merge: <change-name>` on main and no change branch left
- **THEN** finish reports `Nothing to finish - archive is on <main>` and makes no commit, merge or branch deletion

#### Scenario: Archive commit not found
- **WHEN** finish runs for a change that has no change directory, no archive commit on its branch and no archive on main
- **THEN** finish makes no commit or merge and reports that it found no archive of the change

#### Scenario: Archive committed on the branch but archive paths dirty
- **WHEN** the archive commit is on the change branch and a file under the archive directory has uncommitted changes
- **THEN** finish merges nothing, lists that file, and asks the user
